Tasks to achieve:

# Project 1) Create a measurement system with RP picoW board, RP400, BMP280 sensor and other hardware
  
  Features: 
  
  - Wirelessly transmit the sensor data to RP400 1) Using MQTT , 2) Using HTTP
  - Log the data in CSV files 1) - Using node red, 2) - Using python scripts
  - Display the data on a dashboard from 1) Node - Red, HTML based page
  - Presentation: Option to download images from specific timestamps, option to save data in CSV
  - Networking: Dashboard accesible to other non-admin user via HTTP/API/MQTT
  - Building a local data server on RP400
