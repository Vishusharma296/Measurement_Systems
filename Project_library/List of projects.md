Tasks to achieve:


Goals: 

### Project 1) Create a measurement system with pico board and BMP280 sensor
  
  features: 
  
  Wirelessly transmit the sensor data to RP400 1) Using MQTT , 2) Using HTTP
  Log the data in CSV files 1) - Using node red, 2) - Using python scripts
  Display the data on a dashboard from Node - Red
  Presentation - 
  
  
*Skills to learn:*
 
 
 HTTP Protocol (python and micropython libraries)
 Working with APIs in Python
 Node-red dashboard - creation and accesing it remotely
 Github - (Documentation (Markdown files), CLI, Branches, Security)
 Working with multi-threading in Micro Python
 
 
Sub Project 1.1) HTTP and MQTT in Micro Python 

-----  HTTP -----

urequest, ujson
 
 
 
Sub Project 1.2) Multi-threading in Micro Python

Executing multiple tasks concurrently within a single program
Lightweight threads / Croutines /green threads
Tasks that can be performed concurrently - handling user Input, background calculations, communicating with external devices
Cooperative vs preemptive threading
Deadlocks and avoiding deadlocks by careful design of concurrency model
Race conditions - outcome of program depends on the timing or interleaving of operations between multiplethreads
It happens due to threads sharing resources without proper synchronization / Without proper locking / inconsistent interleaving of operations.

Syncronization mechanisms - locks, semaphores and concurrency primitives, Asynchronous I/O, Event driven programming
Concurrency in Micro Python - Coroutines, cooperative multitasking, concurrency primitives
 
Communication between threads - Shared data structure, Queues, Event flags, shared resources (files, sockets, peripherals), message passing / callbacks
 
 
### Project 1.3) Node-Red dashboards


### Project 1.4) Github 



### Project 3) PCB design



### Project 4) Hypersonic flow, 

Things to learn about:

Control of vehicles, 
Communication with hypersonic object, 
CFD - PINN vs traditional approach, 
Plasma around surfaces,


### Project 5) Telemetry
Telemetry in space as used by professional space agencies


### Project 6) Cyber security and cryptography

- Elleiptic curve cryptography
- Public key, private key cryptography 
- RSA
- Deffie-Hellman algorithm
- Hardware encryption 

### Project 7)
