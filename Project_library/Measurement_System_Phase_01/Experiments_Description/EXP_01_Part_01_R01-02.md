# Experiment 01, Run 01-02 

## Detailed Description of Experiment 01 - Part one

### Objective: Create a wireless sensor data measurement system. 

Its various sub systems performs the following tasks:
- RPI picoW reads the sensor data from a BMP280 sensor using I2C every 10 seconds.
- RPI picoW sends the sensor data to an MQTT server (hosted by RPI400) in JSON format by acting as an MQTT publisher.
- A Node-red client running on the same RPI400 acts as an MQTT subscriber. The Node-red flow parses the incoming JSON messages and converts them into CSV format.
- Node-red client logs these messages in a CSV file in the local machine continously
- Later, the collected data is visualized using Python and Jupyter notebooks

## Key Info:

### General information about the experimental setup:

- Communication Protocols: MQTT for publishing node to broker, I2C from sensor to MCU
- Database System: CSV file Writing
- Data Visualization: Using Python and Jupyter notebooks

### Software Tools used: 
- Mosquitto MQTT broker
- Node-red flow for MQTT client and data logging
- BMP280 and umqtt python libraray

### Hardware Tools used:
- RPI picoW board as MQTT publisher
- RPI400 as MQTT server, MQTT subscribing client, database system for logged sensor data in CSV format
- BMP280 temperature pressure sensor
- Mi Powerbank 2i (10,000 mAh) to power sensor node

### Software Description

#### Firmware for publishing node:

Firmware for the publishing node written on RPI picoW performs the following functions:
- It connects to the WiFi connection with known SSID and Password
- It establishes the MQTT connection with broker at local IP address
- If the connection is successfull it reads the temperature pressure data from BMP280 sensor
- It publishes JSON message containing sensor data and other information about node to pre-specified MQTT topic
- Sensor data is sent every 10 seconds and it flashes an led for one second on successful publication of message 

#### Node-Red Flow

#### Data analysis

**Run 01**
- Duration: 29.03.2024 - 03.04.2024
- Polling frequency for sensor: 10 sec
- Total number of samples: 43,416

**Run 02**
- Duration: 06.04.2024 - 10.04.2024
- Polling frequency for sensor: 10 sec
- Total number of samples: 37,436

**Description of jupyter notebooks**
- CSV data was cleaned and imported into the notebook as Pandas dataframe
- Dataframe was changed to include timestamp vectors for the collected sensor data
- Temperature and pressure data over the days was plotted as time series chart
- In another graph pressure was changed from pascal to kPa and plotted on the same graph as time series


### Planned changes for next iterations of the experiment:

#### Firmware

- Change firmware by using concurrent programming: multi-threading, async io etc.
- Now the sensor should poll the data every 10 seconds but connects to WiFi and sends the data say every 2-5 minutes and blinks LED.
- This data should be stored in the buffer memory. Old buffer should be cleared every 2-5 minutes even if node is not able to connect to the WiFi and MQTT Server
- Structure of the sent messages needs to be changed. It should include a unique device Id, sensor data, and a message counter
- Later efforts should be made to change the messages in JSON format to byte text (Hopefully base64/Hex).
- The purpose of doing this is to make the message as short as possible. There should be option to convert back this byte text into plain human readable format.

#### Database and logging system

- Change the data logging system from CSV to time-series database using influx DB
- Influx DB inserts the timestamp automatically


#### Data visualization

- Change the data visualization from jupyter notebooks to react charts/ graffana dashboards
