# Measurement System Phase II

The main theme of the Project Phase II is computation and algorithms. 

## Key Tasks
- Retrieve the data stored in the database (InfluxDB/Postgre SQL) using Python Scripts
- Plot the data and results of the analysis using the standard python plotting tools
- 

## Skills Required

### 1) Basics of Time series data analysis

- Time domain algorithms 
- Timestamps | ISO8601 format, TZ format
- ARIMA like models
- Trend and Seasonality
- Pattern Recognition

### 2) Data Analysis using non-conventional approach: 

- Frequency domain methods
- Fourier Analysis - DFT computation, FFT Implementation
- Time-Frequency domain analysis
- Spectrograms
- Hilbert Huang Transform
- Hilbert Spectral Analysis
- Variants of HHT and EMD

### 3) Data analysis using ML models

- Machine Learning Basics 
- Machine learning for time series data
- Common ML models for analysing time-series data
- Scikit Learn
- XGBoost
- Facebook prophet
